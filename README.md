## Ctf

- this is a practice for spotting vulnerabilities in a contract,
- this contract's vulnerability lies witthin the `claimInterest` function of the `StakeKing.sol` contract and the vulnerability is that the function doesn't reset the claim time of the user after a successful claim has been done.
